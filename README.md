AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes **how AI agents connect to front-end applications**.

‚û°Ô∏è See demos of AG-UI-enabled applications [here](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#ag-ui-compatible-agent-frameworks)

## AG-UI Specification

AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol for agent-human interaction, designed for simplicity & flexibility:

- During agent executions, agent backends **emit events _compatible_ with one of AG-UI's 16 standard event types**
- Agent backends can **accept one of a few simple AG-UI compatible inputs** as arguments

**AG-UI includes a flexible middleware layer** that ensures compatibility across diverse environments:

- Works with **any event transport** (SSE, WebSockets, webhooks, etc.)
- Allows for **loose event format matching**, enabling broad agent and app interoperability

It also ships with a **reference HTTP implementation** and **default connector** to help teams get started fast.

## Why AG-UI?

AG-UI was developed based on real-world requirements and practical experience building in-app agent interactions.

It was shaped through:

- Working with users in the CopilotKit community to understand the needs of agent-based interactions in applications
- Collaborating closely with leading agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra, CrewAI, AG2, etc.)
- Extracting common infrastructure patterns that emerged across varied frameworks into a standardized, open protocol

This practical approach has helped ensure that AG-UI is both flexible and immediately applicable in real-world use cases.
